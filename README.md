## 📖 Project Overview
This project explores how Earth’s temperature has changed over the last **175+ years** by analyzing global temperature anomaly data. The goal is to identify long-term warming trends, regional differences, and the severity of modern climate change compared to pre-industrial levels.

The resulting dashboard visualizes the velocity of global warming, highlights the most affected regions, and provides a comparative analysis of recent decades against historical records.

## 🌡️ What is a Temperature Anomaly?
A temperature anomaly represents the deviation of the actual temperature from a reference long-term average. It is calculated as:

$$\text{Anomaly} = T_{\text{actual}} - T_{\text{baseline}}$$

Using anomalies provides a more accurate representation of climate change than absolute temperatures because it mitigates the impact of station location and elevation.
* **Positive Anomaly (+):** Warmer than the average.
* **Negative Anomaly (-):** Cooler than the average.

## 📊 Key Problem Statements
This analysis addresses four critical questions regarding climate change:

### 1️⃣ Long-Term Global Warming Trend (1850–2025)
* **Question:** How has the global temperature anomaly changed over time?
* **Focus:** Identifying the specific decades where warming trends began to accelerate significantly.

### 2️⃣ Regional Warming Comparison
* **Question:** Which region—Northern Hemisphere, Southern Hemisphere, or the Globe as a whole—is heating up the fastest?
* **Focus:** Comparative analysis of regional warming rates.

### 3️⃣ Past vs. Present Warming Analysis
* **Question:** Is the recent warming period (2000–2025) significantly more intense than the pre-industrial period (1850–1900)?
* **Focus:** Quantifying the difference in temperature deviations between these two eras.

### 4️⃣ Top 10 Hottest Years on Record
* **Question:** What are the hottest years ever recorded?
* **Focus:** Determining if these record-breaking years cluster within the most recent decades.

## 📉 Visualizations & Strategy
To deliver a clear, data-driven narrative, the dashboard utilizes the following analytical techniques:
* **Line Charts & Trendlines:** To visualize the continuous rise in global temperatures.
* **Top-N Analysis:** To isolate and rank the hottest years.
* **Period Comparisons:** Contrasting pre-industrial data with modern data.
* **Regional Filtering:** allowing users to toggle between Hemispheric views.

## 📁 Data Source
The analysis is based on Global Historical Temperature Anomaly datasets compiled from scientific climate records, spanning from **1850 to 2025**.
*(Note: You can link the specific dataset here, e.g., NASA GISS, NOAA, or Kaggle link)*

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
* **Data Cleaning:** [e.g., Python / Excel / SQL]
* **Visualization:** [e.g., Power BI / Tableau / Matplotlib]
* **Analysis:** [e.g., Pandas / DAX]

## 🚀 How to Use
1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Load the dataset located in the `/data` folder.
3.  Open the dashboard file (`.pbix`, `.twbx`, or `.ipynb`) to interact with the visualizations.
